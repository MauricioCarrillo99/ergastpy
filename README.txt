Ergast is an API that stores long-term data of formula-1 races. erpy2set package is just an unofficial extension of the Ergast API which provides functions to retrieve data from this source.
This package doesn't pretend to steal the work of others, the main goal of this package is to make the information of the API more accessible, focusing just to retrieve data to perform data analysis from this source using python, allowing the users only to focus on the analysis instead of on the retrieving and cleaning of the entities.
