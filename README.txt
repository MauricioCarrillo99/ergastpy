# ergastpy

ergastpy is an API wrapper of Ergast Developer API, a module that allows a quick and easy interaction with Ergast API, making it possible to gather information from the F1 competition for all types of users, especially those not experienced in working with APIs.
Ergast is an API that stores long-term data of formula-1 races. erpy2set package is just an unofficial extension of the Ergast API which provides functions to retrieve data from this source.
This package doesn't pretend to steal the work of others, the main goal of this package is to make the information of the API more accessible, focusing on retrieving data to perform data analysis from this source using Python, allowing the users only to focus on the analysis instead of on the retrieving and cleaning of the entities.
